>Musk has spent years touting Tesla‚Äôs work in autonomous cars and promising that they would hit the market. Along the way, he‚Äôs repeatedly woven a fantastical vision for shareholders, setting and missing his own deadlines.

>In 2015, Musk told shareholders that Tesla cars would achieve ‚Äúfull autonomy‚Äù within three years. They didn‚Äôt. In 2016, Musk said a Tesla car would be able to make a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention before the end of 2017. That never happened. And in 2019, on a call with institutional investors that would help him raise more than $2 billion, Musk said Tesla would have 1 million robotaxi-ready vehicles on the road in 2020, able to complete 100 hours of driving work per week each, making money for their owners.

>In April this year, Musk was still telling investors autonomy is the company‚Äôs future.
