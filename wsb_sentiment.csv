>Musk has spent years touting Tesla’s work in autonomous cars and promising that they would hit the market. Along the way, he’s repeatedly woven a fantastical vision for shareholders, setting and missing his own deadlines.

>In 2015, Musk told shareholders that Tesla cars would achieve “full autonomy” within three years. They didn’t. In 2016, Musk said a Tesla car would be able to make a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention before the end of 2017. That never happened. And in 2019, on a call with institutional investors that would help him raise more than $2 billion, Musk said Tesla would have 1 million robotaxi-ready vehicles on the road in 2020, able to complete 100 hours of driving work per week each, making money for their owners.

>In April this year, Musk was still telling investors autonomy is the company’s future.

>“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” he said on a call with analysts. “We will, and we are.”",6,2024-10-11 05:39:25,"{'ANY': 1, 'CAR': 1, 'HAS': 2, 'ON': 3, 'ROAD': 1, 'WAY': 1}",0.23750000000000002,0.4395833333333334,0.019,0.92,0.061,0.8074
